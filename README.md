### Hi, I'm Rafit! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a rising Senior at the University of Waterloo where I study Software Engineering.

I currently work as a SWE Intern @ [Amazon](https://github.com/amzn). Previously I was @ [Salesforce](https://github.com/salesforce), [Salesforce](https://github.com/meterparts), [Setter](https://github.com/setter) and [MLSE](https://github.com/torontofc).

Let's connect. :coffee:
