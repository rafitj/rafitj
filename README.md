### Hi, I'm Rafit! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a SWE @ [Google](https://github.com/google). 

I studied Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo.

Previously I was at [Meta](https://github.com/facebook), [Amazon](https://github.com/amzn), [Salesforce](https://github.com/salesforce), [Lumafield](https://github.com/lumafield), [Setter](https://github.com/setter) and [MLSE](https://github.com/torontofc).
